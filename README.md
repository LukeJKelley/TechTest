#Google Books Tech Test

#MVP

Designed to test my post-course skills on a project I have worked on previously, to see how much I have improved and anything I require more practice on
I used React native for the body of my application alongside scss, and Javascript for functions.

-Fetch and display a list of books related to flowers from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers
-Present the fetched data in a table, including book title, authors, and published date.
-Enable users to view more details of a selected book:
*Title
*Subtitle
*Authors
*Image
*Description
-Create a visually appealing UI



#Build Steps

To run application enter the following commands in your gitbash/terminal

```cd Google-Book-Search```
```npm install```
```npm run dev```
 then select local by, copying the URL or typing local + enter
 
 #Design Goals
 
 I aimmed to improve on my previous version on Google Books, by impelementing more features (such as the sort function)
 I also aimmed for a more modular design and better file structure to make for overall more reusable code.
 
#Additional Features that have been added

-Sorting books by:
*Title
*Author
*Publish date
 
 #Issues
 
 -Application doesn't pass book information to the BookDetails page correctly. Page routes to correct page
 
 #Future Goals
 -Fix bugs
 -Make UI more visually appealing
 -Add tests
 -Add media queries
